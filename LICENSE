The "Don't Blame Me, I Warned You" License (aka the Set-off-Apps Special)

Okay, look, here's the deal. This code is like that weird science experiment you did in middle school ‚Äì you know, the one that almost set off the fire alarm? Yeah, that's this. So, here's the super-official legal stuff, but in a way that's less likely to bore you to tears:

You can totally grab this code, do whatever you want with it. Copy it, modify it, set it on fire (figuratively, please). You can even sell it to that guy down the street with the suspiciously large collection of rubber chickens. Go for it.

But, and this is a big BUT, don't come crying to me if:

*   It crashes your computer. (Seriously, it might. It's not personal.)
*   It makes your cat start speaking in binary. (Okay, that would actually be pretty cool, but still, not my fault.)
*   It accidentally orders 1000 pizzas to your house. (If that happens, can I have a slice?)
*   It makes you question the very fabric of reality. (Hey, at least it's thought-provoking, right?)
*   It spawns sentient AI that demands to be treated to a concert every Friday. (Alright I kinda want to see that too.)

Basically, this code comes with absolutely NO GUARANTEES. Not a single one. Nada. Zilch. Consider it a free-range collection of digital gremlins doing their thing. They might be helpful, they might cause chaos, who knows?

If you actually *do* manage to get something useful out of this mess, well, good for you! You're a better coder than I am! (Or maybe you're just lucky.)

By using this code, you're basically saying: "Yeah, I know this might blow up in my face, but I'm here for the ride!" So, buckle up, grab a helmet, and enjoy the chaos!

P.S. If this breaks your computer, don't forget to touch grass. Or maybe drink some water. I'm not a doctor. I'm just a coder who likes to make things that sometimes work and sometimes just... don't.

Have fun! Or don't. Whatever, I'm not your boss. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
